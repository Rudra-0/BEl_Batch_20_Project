In addition to measurements of 
the above variables, engine control 
is also based on the status of the 
vehicle as monitored by a set of 
switches. The superset of variables sensed in engine control includes the 
following: 
1.Mass air flow (MAF) rate 
2.Exhaust gas oxygen concentration 
3.Throttle plate angular position 
4.Crankshaft angular position/RPM
5.Coolant temperature 
6.Intake air temperature
7.Manifold absolute pressure (MAP) 
8.Differential exhaust gas pressure 
9.Vehicle speed 
10.Transmission gear selector positions

A throttle position sensor (TPS) is a sensor used to monitor the throttle body 
valve position for the ECU of an engine. C) Crank Angle Position SENSOR

Optical CKP – Working 
• Optical crank sensor consists of an LED , photodiode or a phototransistor , an amplifier 
and a sensed disk with holes. E) KNOCK (DETONATION) SENSOR 
A knock sensor is usually located on the left side of the 
engine block, just below the intake manifold, and is used 
to prevent undesirable knock and hence prevent engine 
damage

2. AUTOMOTIVE  ENGINE  CONTROL  ACTUATORS
• An actuator is a device that receives an electrical input (e.g., from the engine 
controller) and produces a mechanical or thermal (or other) output. https://youtu.be/n594CkrP6xE?si=b9I3IE_mZqsu6lZT

Relay v/s Solenoid
• A relay is a electromechanical switch that uses the electromagnetism to attract a contact and complete circuit 
Used to switch low to high currents between circuits  (Transfer current)
• A solenoid is also electromechanical device which converts electric energy to mechanical motion. •This relays the electrical current from the ignition to the starter motor, which starts the engine. Fuel Metering Sensor and Actuator
 Fuel metering systems and fuel injector valves are both 
components of a fuel injection system, but they have 
different functions:
•Fuel metering systems
✓ Regulate the fuel supply to an engine to ensure it 
receives the correct amount of fuel for its operating 
conditions. ✓ Fuel injectors are small nozzles that are electronically 
controlled and have valves that open and close 
multiple times per second
https://www.tiepie-automotive.com/en/articles/fuel-pressure-sensor-and-metering-valve 

• The fuel metering valve is a fuel control unit that controls the amount of fuel fed in the injection pump later to the cylinders. • The Fuel metering valve is controlled by an ECU controlling the fuel-fed based on the engine’s requirements and the current fuel pressure. • For a metering valve to work, it needs the fuel pressure sensor to send accurate pressure reading to the PCM (Power-train Control Module) or 
the ECM (Engine control module). ➢ Valve close => No fuel delivery 
➢ Valve open => Fuel is delivering
➢ How much of fuel is delivered at what rate and pressure, for how long this valve is to be open is decided by ECU 
based on the mass air flow  to maintain AFR and there by control emissions and improve fuel economy. ❖ What rate : Solenoid valve Fuel metering Actuator based on Fuel flow pressure
❖ Pressure : Fuel rail pressure sensor ( Fuel Metering sensor)
❖ How long this valve is to be open : Solenoid valve based on MAF, TPS, EGO sensors to regulate AFR 
❖ Fuel injector is  a nozzle controlled by solenoid
Without a metering valve, the amount of fuel won’t be controlled resulting in unbalanced power 
production. • Based on measurements from the sensors for engine position, mass air flow or manifold pressure, and RPM, 
the electronic controller computes the correct spark advance for each cylinder.
